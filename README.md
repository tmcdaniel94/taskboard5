# Task Board Starter Code

## Description
This project was from Module 5 of the Bootcamp course, and targets all that we have learned about Javascript and Web APIs in the last few weeks. This project has been the most challenging one so far for me, but I feel was a good review of many of the skills I will need in the future. Those skills include DayJS, JQuery, creating elements using user input, and deleting elements using event listener buttons.
